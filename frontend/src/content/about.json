    "Life presents moments when the right choice isn't obvious—when duty conflicts with desire, when multiple paths seem equally valid, or when the consequences of any decision feel uncertain.",
    "For over two thousand years, people have turned to the Bhagavad Geeta in such moments. Not for simple answers, but for perspectives that illuminate the question itself. The Geeta is a 700-verse conversation about how to act when the way forward isn't clear, how to balance personal values with responsibility, and how to find equanimity amid life's complexity.",
    "Geetanjali brings this wisdom into a form you can engage with directly—whether you're facing a career crossroads, navigating relationships, working through ethical questions, or simply seeking clarity. Share a dilemma, and receive thoughtful perspectives grounded in verses from the Geeta, presented accessibly and without sectarian framing.",
    "This is not meant to replace your judgment or offer definitive answers. Think of Geetanjali as one thoughtful companion among many—a way to encounter timeless philosophy when you need it most."
